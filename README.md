# statsnite-bot

statsnite-bot is a (potentially outdated) Discord bot that returns Fortnite player data within Discord. This bot relies heavily upon the Node.js Fortnite API created by qlaffont. statsnite-bot pulls information from Fortnite using the Fortnite API, converts the JSON into structured text, and returns it to the user using Discord.js.

## Installation

Modify the App.js file to connect to the Fortnite API using your Fortnite account information, add your Discord bot token to the config file, and run the app.js file in a PM2 environment.

## Usage

Once invited to your Discord server, use !statshelp to see a list of commands.

## Contributing
